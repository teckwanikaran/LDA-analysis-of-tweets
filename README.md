#### Structure of notebook:

- Use the spark streaming libraries with the Twitter developer API authenticator
- Stream live Twitter data from its platform
- Clean and isolate the English language tweets
- Batch stream the context and store in local directory as text files
- Separate the status/text of tweets into words to build the words LDA model
- Extract the hashtags from the tweets to build the hashtags LDA model
